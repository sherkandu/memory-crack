# memory-crack
Memory Crack is a game that helps families and other people who are dealing with a friend, patient or family member struggling with Dementia and related diseases like Alzheimer's.  Crack open a memory today!
I have used Game Salad to start creating this game in honor of my Mother, who walked on in 2017 after dealing with dementia for almost a decade. It might have only been 8 years but it seemed like more.  She was an adventurer, a sailor and a witty woman.  Following the Git Hub example of a read me file I feel obligated to share that I have not had tacos on the moon however I have had Sheepshead tacos and they are a delicious snack to help replenish ones stores after a hard day of coding.
